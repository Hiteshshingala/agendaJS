# Introduction
This repository contains a code sample that demonstrates the usage of AgendaJS, a powerful job scheduling library for Node.js applications. The sample showcases the integration of cron jobs with database functionality to efficiently process and sign documents in a government application for the Philippines.

# Why Use AgendaJS
AgendaJS offers several benefits for handling cron jobs in Node.js applications:

```
  npm install agenda
  
```
- Easy and intuitive API for defining and scheduling jobs
- Flexible job configuration and customization options
- Database integration for persistence and reliability
- Scalability for processing large volumes of data and tasks
- Fault tolerance and error handling mechanisms

# Problem and Solution
In my previous role as a senior JavaScript developer, we encountered a challenge while working on a government application for the Philippines. The application required handling a large number of users simultaneously, as well as processing and signing numerous documents using blockchain technology.

To accommodate the high server load, our DevOps team suggested vertical scaling. However, we faced a development hurdle in ensuring that the same record was not processed multiple times by different servers.

After thorough research and analysis, I identified a suitable solution using AgendaJS. By integrating AgendaJS cron jobs with database functionality, we could ensure seamless processing and eliminate the risk of duplicating tasks across multiple servers.
